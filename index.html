                Excellent Engineering & Allied Service Private Limited and since M/s </p>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight:400;">Excellent Engineering & Allied Service Private Limited is not a listed company
                which therefore, does not meet the requirement of Clause 2.1(a) of the NIT document, which requires that
                the bidder must have an experience of successfully supplied/executed at least one single purchase order
                for a similar item during the previous three financial years. He also states that the experience
                certificate submitted by APL Apollo Steel Pipes was in fact issued to M/s Excellent Engineering & Allied
                Service Private Limited which is also not acceptable because the certificate has not been issued by APL
                Apollo Steel Pipes in favour of the Petitioner. </p>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">Heard learned Counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">A perusal of Clause 2.1 shows that the qualification criteria stipulates that a
            manufacturer or an authorized dealer of a manufacturer must have the experience of successfully
            supplying/executing at least one purchase order of government departments/CPSCs/SPSCs/ Public Limited
            Companies etc. for a similar item during the previous three years and the last day of the current financial
            year previous to the one in which the tender is invited. It also stipulates that the bidder and the
            authorized dealer both cannot simultaneously bid for the same item or product in the same tender. </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">
            <p style="font-weight:400;">
            <p style="font-weight:400;">Admittedly, M/s Excellent Engineering & Allied Service Private Limited has
                withdrawn from the tender even before the last date of submission of the tender. The question that
                arises for consideration is as to whether the certificate issued by APL Apollo Steel Pipes to M/s
                Excellent Engineering & Allied Service Private Limited for having supplied the forklift can be
                considered in favour of the Petitioner who is the manufacturer and whether the rejection of the said
                certificate issued by APL Apollo Steel </p>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight:400;">Pipes should be discarded only because it has been issued in favour of M/s
                Excellent Engineering & Allied Service Private Limited. </p>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">Clause 2.1 stipulates that in order to be considered for the tender, the
            manufacturer or an authorized dealer has to prove of having successfully supplied or executed one purchase
            order. The certificate issued by APL Apollo Steel Pipes shows that M/s Excellent Engineering & Allied
            Service Private Limited has supplied the machine manufactured by the Petitioner. </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">The reason given by Respondent No.1 that just because the certificate issued by APL
            Apollo Steel Pipes was in favour of M/s Excellent Engineering & Allied Service Private Limited. This reason
            cannot be accepted because that certificate shows that the machine manufactured by the Petitioner has been
            executed by M/s Excellent Engineering & Allied Service Private Limited with Apollo Steel Pipes. </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">No doubt, it is well settled that judicial review in administrative actions that
            too in matters of tender is extremely limited. However, judicial review can be exercised to prevent
            arbitrariness, irrationality and unreasonableness. </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">
            <p style="font-weight:400;">
            <p style="font-weight:400;">It is now well settled and has been held by the Apex Court in times without
                number that basic requirement of Article 14 of the Constitution of India in action by the State and
                non-arbitrariness in essence and substance is the heartbeat of fair play and State actions are amenable
                to the judicial review to the extent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason and not
                whimsically. If the State or instrumentality of State does not act reasonably or fairly in awarding
                contracts, then the Court has to step in exercising its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of
                India. The Apex Court in <span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;">Vice Chairman &

                    style="font-weight:700;">2021 SCC OnLine SC 1141 </span>has observed as under:- </p>
            <ul style="font-weight:400;">
                <li style="font-weight:400;">"<span style="font-weight:700;">72. </span>Before we state the conclusions,
                    this Court would like to reiterate certain well-established tenets of law pertaining to Government
                    contracts. When we speak of Government contracts, constitutional factors are also in play.
                    Governmental bodies being public authorities are expected to uphold fairness, equality and rule of
                    law even while dealing with contractual matters. It is a settled principle that right to equality
                    under Article 14 abhors arbitrariness. Public authorities have to ensure that no bias, favouritism
                    or arbitrariness are shown during the bidding process. A transparent bidding process is much
                    favoured by this Court to ensure that constitutional requirements are satisfied. </li>
                <li style="font-weight:700;">Fairness and the good faith standard ingrained in the contracts entered
                    into by public authorities mandates such public authorities to conduct themselves in a non-arbitrary
                    manner during the performance of their contractual obligations. </li>
                <li style="font-weight:700;">The constitutional guarantee against arbitrariness as provided under
                    Article 14, demands the State to act in a fair and reasonable manner unless public interest demands
                    otherwise. However, the degree of compromise of any private legitimate interest must correspond
                    proportionately to the public interest, so claimed. </li>
                <li style="font-weight:700;">
                    <p style="font-weight:400;">
                    <p style="font-weight:400;">At this juncture, it is pertinent to remember that, by merely using
                        grounds of public interest or loss to the treasury, the successor public authority cannot undo
                        the work undertaken by the previous authority. Such a claim must be proven using material facts,
                        evidence and figures. If it were otherwise, then there will remain no sanctity in the words and
                        undertaking of the Government. Businessmen will be hesitant to enter Government contract or make
                        any investment in </p>
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-weight:400;">furtherance of the same. Such a practice is counter<span
                            style="font-weight:400;">-</span>productive to the economy and the business environment in
                        general." <span style="font-weight:400;">(emphasis supplied) </span></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="">
        <li style="font-weight:400;">It is well settled and has been stated by the Apex Court that arbitrariness is the
            antithesis of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and the State has to act in a fair and reasonable
            manner. As stated above, in order to meet the qualification criteria all that had to be shown by the bidder
            who is a manufacturer is that it is having the experience of supplying at least one single purchase order of
            government departments, CPSEs, SPSEs, Public listed companies, ICD, DCT, MMLP, Ports, CFS, CTOs for similar
            item during previous three financial years and current financial year last day of month previous to the one
            in which tender is invited. </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">The reason given by Respondent No.1 that since the certificate has been issued by
            APL Apollo Steel Pipes only in favour of supplier, and, therefore, it cannot inure in favour of the
            manufacturer, cannot be accepted. </li>
        <li style="font-weight:400;">
            <p style="font-weight:400;">At this juncture, it is apposite to reproduce Clause 5.4 along with Annexure-10
