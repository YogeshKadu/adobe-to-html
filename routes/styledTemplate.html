        <h1 style=""><span style="font-weight:700;text-decoration:underline;">MANMOHAN, ACJ </span>: (ORAL) </h1>
        <ul style="">
            <li style="font-weight:400;">Present writ petitions have been filed challenging the orders dated
                25<span style="font-weight:400;font-size:0.75rem;position:relative;bottom:0.4rem;">th </span>July, 2022
                passed under Section 148A(d) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for
                <span style="font-weight:400;">short „Act‟) for the Assessment Years 2015</span>-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and
                further challenging the notices dated
                25<span style="font-weight:400;font-size:0.75rem;position:relative;bottom:0.4rem;">th </span>July, 2022
                issued under Section 148 of the Act. The petitioner further challenges the constitutional validity of
                Section 115BBE of the Act. </li>
            <li style="font-weight:400;">Learned counsel for the Petitioner states that the notices issued under Section 148
                of the Act have been issued after three years from the end of the relevant Assessment Years and that too
                could have been issued after obtaining the sanction from the Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax and
                not from the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax as has been done in the present cases. </li>
            <li style="font-weight:400;">Learned counsel for the Respondents-Revenue, who appears on advance notice, states
                that in the present cases, after passing of the order under Section 148A(d) of the Act, final assessment
                orders have been passed on
                9<span style="font-weight:400;font-size:0.75rem;position:relative;bottom:0.4rem;">th </span>May, 2023,
                27<span style="font-weight:400;font-size:0.75rem;position:relative;bottom:0.4rem;">th </span>April, 2023 and
                18<span style="font-weight:400;font-size:0.75rem;position:relative;bottom:0.4rem;">th </span>May, 2023 for
                the Assessment Years 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 respectively. He further states that the issue of limitation,
                being a mixed question of fact and law in the present batch of matters, should be raised before the
                Appellate Authorities. </li>
            <li style="font-weight:400;">
                <p style="font-weight:400;">At this stage, learned counsel for the petitioner states that the issue of
                    constitutional validity of Section 115BBE of the Act cannot be adjudicated upon by the Appellate
                    Authority. In support of his submission, he refers to ground T of one of the paper books. The same is
                    reproduced hereinbelow:- </p>
                <p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:700;">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:700;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:700;">T. </span>The
                    Petitioner further submits that the invocation of section 115BBE in the present case is grossly unfair.
                    The Petitioner seeks the indulgence of our Hon'ble Court in determining the Constitutional vires of
                    section 115BBE of the Act in as much as the same is violative of Article 14, Article 19 as also the
                    fundamental Economic Justice guaranteed in the Constitution. In the humble submission of the Petitioner
                    the section is prone to abuse based on a subjective exercise of discretion whereby it will completely
                    depend on the subjective opinion and subjective satisfaction of the Assessing Officer as to whether in a
                    particular case sections 68 to 69D should be invoked or not. Admittedly, the very sections 68 to 69D are
                    discretionary in nature and not mandatory [Ref. CIT v/s P.K. Noorjahan
                    <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">– </span>(1999) 237 ITR 670 (SC)] and because of that
                    they are prone to the vice of perversity in exercise thereof. This may lead to a situation where
                    similarly placed assessees may be subjected to differential treatment under the Act based on the
                    discretion of the Assessing officer. The very section 115BBE is prone to mischief. It can be manifested
                    by way of a simple illustration. Suppose two different assesses in the very same business earning the
                    very same nature of income are assessed before the same Assessing Officer wherein income from business
                    earned in cash is disclosed by both the Assessees. The said income is taxable u/s 28 of the Act. It
                    needs to be mentioned that even incomes to which sections 68 to 69D apply have to be classified under
                    one of the specific heads as per section 14. Now, if the Assessing Officer chooses to apply section 68
                    to business income earned in cash in the case of one assessee and chooses not to do so in the case of
                    another assessee, it will lead to absolutely unfair levy of tax because the Assessee in whose case the
                    said section 68 is applied would end up being charged with more than double the tax liability [since
                    from AY 2017-18 tax u/s 115BBE is 60% plus 25% surcharge and further penalty and interest]. In an even
                    worse situation like the present one, the Assessing Officer could simply invoke section 68 simply to
                    safeguard his invalid action and consequently subject the Assessee to the rigours of section 115BBE
                    simply because the exercise of discretion was inappropriate. It is with utmost respect submitted that
                    the Act, does not provide a safeguard against a biased mind. It is for this reason, the Petitioner seeks
                    indulgence of this <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">Hon'ble </span>Court in redressing
                    the grievance of the injustice caused by section 115BBE of the Act, just as has happened in the present
                    case. The issue becomes even more serious when there is opaqueness in the manner of framing assessments
                    (due to faceless assessments). A true copy of Section 115BBE is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure

            </li>
            <li style="font-weight:400;">It is settled law that Statutory Acts and their provisions are not to be declared
                unconstitutional on the fanciful theory that power would be exercised in an unrealistic fashion or in a
                vacuum or on the ground that there is an apprehension of misuse of Statutory Provision or possibility of
                abuse of power. It must be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that administration and application of a
                particular law would be done
                <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">“not with an evil eye and unequal hand”</span>. In
                <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:700;">Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. Vs. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay & Ors., (1974) 2 SCC 402</span>,
                the Supreme Court has held as under:-</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:700;text-align:justify;">
            <span style="font-weight:400;">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">15</span><span style="font-weight:400;">….. </span>take
            into account. This is not one of those cases where discrimination is writ
            <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:700;">……</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">.” Administrative officers, no less than the courts, do not function in a vacuum. It would be extremely unreal to hold that an administrative officer would in taking proceedings for eviction of unauthorised occupants of Government property or Municipal property resort to the procedure prescribed by the two Acts in one case and to the ordinary civil court in the other. The provisions of these two Acts cannot be struck down on the fanciful theory that power would be exercised in such an unrealistic fashion. In considering whether the officers would be discriminating between one set of persons and another, one has got to take into account normal human behaviour and not behaviour which is abnormal. It is not every fancied possibility of discrimination but the real risk of discrimination that we must large on the face of the statute. Discrimination may be possible but is very improbable</span>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            <span style="font-weight:400;">“</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">34....</span>This Court
            has held in numerous rulings, to which it is unnecessary to refer, that the possibility of the abuse of the
            powers under the provisions contained in any statute is no ground for declaring the provision to be unreasonable
            or void. Commenting on a passage in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland which stated: </p>
        <p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">490 at pp. 520-521] : “If such powers are capable of being exercised
            reasonably it is impossible to say that they may not also be exercised unreasonably” and treating this as a
            ground for holding the statute invalid Viscount Simonds observed in Belfast Corporation v. O.D. Commission [1960
            AC </p>
        <p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;text-align:justify;">
            <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">“It appears to me that the short answer to this contention (and I hope </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">its shortness will not be regarded as disrespect) is that the validity of a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">measure is not to be determined by its application to particular cases.… </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">the statute.” If it is not so exercised (i.e. if the powers are abused) it is open to challenge and there is no need for express provision for its challenge in </span>
        </p>
        <p style="">
            <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">The possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does not impart to it </span>any

            invalidity<span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;">……..</span>.<span style="font-weight:400;">” </span>
        </p>
        <ul style="">
            <li style="font-weight:400;">Consequently, at this stage, Section 115BBE of the Act cannot be held
                unconstitutional on the ground that there is an apprehension of misuse of the said provision. </li>
            <li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">]. </span>Further, it is settled law that the Act
                provides a complete machinery for assessment/re-assessment of tax and the assessee is not permitted to
                abandon that machinery to invoke jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution [See :
                Commissioner of Income Tax & Ors. vs. Chhabil Dass Agarwal, (2014) 1 SCC 603</li>
